rubber-duck-debugger
====================

All of my rubber duck debuggers, finally brought together under one roof!

## Usage

Use something like [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) to serve the src directory, then browse to any of the specific duck html files to see them in action. Hopefully they all look pretty darn similar, and should behave similarly too!
